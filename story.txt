There was once a steam engine named stan. Stan the steam engine they called him. One day, stan came upon hill. This was the biggest hill he had every seen. At the sight of this big hill, stan became very scared. How was he going to get over this hill?
'Maybe I can ask for help?' he thought, but there was no one around. 'Maybe I can go around?' he thought as well, but no tracks led around the hill. He finally came to the realization, thinking to himself, 'I am going to have to push myself and go over it myself.'
