There was once a steam engine named stan. Stan the steam engine they called him. One day, stan came upon hill. This was the biggest hill he had every seen. At the sight of this big hill, stan became very scared. How was he going to get over this hill?
'Maybe I can ask for help?' he thought, but there was no one around. 'Maybe I can go around?' he thought as well, but no tracks led around the hill. He finally came to the realization, thinking to himself, 'I am going th myself and go over it myself.'
In that moment stan activated his big magnet.  The magnet repelled itself from the tracks pushing stan up the hill.  As he nearly reached the top of the hill, his magnet ran out of power and stan fell back down the hillt.
"OK, I need to go over again."he thought."Maybe I can try another way. I can called the superman to help me" Stan did that right away.
Little did Stan know, he was not in the DC universe. Stan was in the Marvel universe, so superman did not exist. All the sudden, Nick Fury appeared out of the shadows. He stated "There was an idea. An idea to assemble a team of remarkable steam engines, to climb the hills that we could never climb when we needed them most." That was all Stan needed- he developed massive rockets and blasted off like Jimmy Neutron, way past the puny hill.

Midway though his flight, he ran out of fuel and started falling. As his life flashed before him, he remembered that he was built, his creator had emergency wings installed. Just in the nick of time, Stan deployed his wings and glided into the station, arriving ahead of schedule. From them on he was known as Stan, the train that arrived on schedule that one time. The end.
